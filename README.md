# **BAT connectome**

This repository includes analyses for predicting genes implicated in the functioning of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT). For that, we select those genes biologically closest to the hallmark of BAT functioning (UCP1) according to predicted protein interactions. Biological distances were obtained from [The Human Genome Connectome](http://lab.rockefeller.edu/casanova/HGC). We also performed a validation of the BAT connectome by testing whether the connectome included genes already associated with BAT and whether these genes were biologically closer to each other and to the rest of genes within the connectome (candidates). Finally, we tested whether the genes included in the BAT connectome were significantly higher expressed in BAT compared to the random expectation, increasing the likelihood that the predicted BAT candidates are indeed implicated in the functioning of BAT. All these analyses and the corresponding results has been published in Scientific Reports ([link to the paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11317-2)).
