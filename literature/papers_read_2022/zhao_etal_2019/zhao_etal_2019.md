# Stimulation of histamine H4 receptor participates in cold-induced browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue


## Introduction

- energy consumption and heat generation measured in a metabolic chamber with the mice inside. temperature with rectal probe.

- also adipocytes were differentiated from pre-adipocytes and mesenchuymal stem cells, but obviously using different treatments in each case, because the latter are less differentiated. Adipocytes coming from the cells are called 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while those coming from the second are called C3H10T1/2 adipocytes.

- they sued adenoviral expression vectors encoding for shRNA of Lacz or Hrh4 gene. A short hairpin RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA/Hairpin Vector) is an artificial RNA molecule with a tight hairpin turn that can be used to silence target gene expression via RNA interference. On the second day following
the last injection, mice underwent the cold tolerance test or metabolic measurements. So they silenced Hrh4 and saw the impact on cold tolerance and metabolism.

- They also applied 4-Methylhistamine treatments in C3H10T1/2 adipocytes (in vitro) and in mice (in vivo) to the subcutaneus WAT.

- They used oil red staining for lipid content in adipocytes.

- They also made experiments with glycerol, which was used as an index of lipolysis. The breaking of triglicerydes produces glycerol. So they check the release of glycerol in the adipocytes after treatment (or no treatment) of CL,316243, which I think it is a thermogenic agonists. They tested if the treatment increase the release of glycerol. More thermogenesis should produce more lypolisis.

- They use antibodies for UCP1 in scWAT from mice.

- For the measurement of lipid droplet (LD) size, we took the longest line throughout the LD as the diameter, performing with the ImageJ software. Data were collected from three independent experiments, five views per experiment, three adipocytes from each view, with all the droplets in each adipocyte.

- They used PCR to calculate the gene expression.

- Protein presence was calculated with western-blot. They also used antibodies in this experiment. I think the used the heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a control for expression changes after cold exposure.

- Experiments were randomized, and investigators were blind to the group allocation during experiments and assessments.


## Results

- Histamine H4 receptor in scWAT is highly induced by cold exposure.
	- From tissue in mice:
		- Increase of Hrh4 expression in subcutaneuos WAT and BAT between room temperature and cold exposure. Much higher increase for scWAT. Non-significant for gonadal WAT. The increase in scWT is confirmed by westernblotting.
		- The increase of Hrh4 expression is higher in the adipocytes than in the stromal vascular fractions (SVFs) within the same scWAT. This is relevant because HrH4 is epxressed in immune cells, and these are present in the SVF of the adipose tissue. But the increase of HrH4 occured in adipocytes, not the SVF.
	- From mature adipocytes of mice (coming from scWAT)
		- higher expression of HrH4 in cold vs room temperature.

- Knockdown of histamine H4 receptor inhibits cold-induced browning in scWAT.
	- Two treatments, knock-down of HrH4 using a shRNA that interferes with the expression of the gene, this is included with an adenovirus. The same is done in controls but silencing lacz. There is no significant increase of Hrh4 mRNA after cold exposure. However, the controls (with lacz silenced but not Hrh4), there is an increase of mRNA expression for Hrh4 after cold exposure. You can see the same for protein amount in westernblots.

	- Controls and knockouts did not show differences in temperature in room temperature, but after cold exposure, the controls showed higher rectal temperature. Therefore, knockouts have problems to control temperature in response to cold conditions.

	- The scWAT of the controls showed lower lipid-droplet size after cold exposure and more expression of UCP1 and PGC1-alpha. The increase after cold exposure is much higher in controls.

	- HSL is a key enzyme in fatty acid mobilization, so it should decrease if thermogenesis is not occuring because after cold exposure, lipolysis increases. It seems that HSL becomes more phosphorilated in controls, but I do not see it very clearly in the plot.

	- The glycerol use increases more in controls (C3H10T1/2 adipocytes), but it also increases a lot in knock-outs. I do not see it clearly in the plot.

	- BAT was NOT affected, BUT remember that they injected the adenovirus solution adjacently to the subcutaneous fat pads, not in BAT, so I think they are specifically testing the impact of HrH4 deletion on WAT, no BAT.

- Knockdown of histamine H4 receptor reduces whole body energy expenditure of mice.
	- During the 2-wk adenovirus injection, we measured the body weight, food intake, and individual fat mass of mice in both groups, whereas there were no significant differences between them
	- We then explored the role of HrH4 in oxygen consump-tion and heat generation through CLAMS analysis. After cold exposure, VO2 consumption becomes significantly higher in the controls for the dark cycle. The same pattern was found for heat production.
	- These results suggested that HrH4 in scWAT participated in the energy expenditure adaptation to the cold environment.
- Activation of HrH4 promotes WAT browning and enhances whole body energy expenditure
	- They injected 4MH, a selective HrH4 agonist with a 100-fold efficacy over other histamine receptors. Controls were injected with PBS.
	- M4 decreased lipid-droplet size and increased the expression of thermogenic genes (UCP1, PPARGC1a, Cidea...). 
	- M4 also increased the expression of carboxypeptidase 3 (Fig. 4D), a protease particularly expressed in mast cell. Besides its recently known role in promoting scWAT browning (13), mast cells are also able to promote group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) expansion and activation during the immune responses (41, 68). In the adipose tissues, activated ILC2s would release cytokines such as IL-5 and methionine- enkephalin peptides to elicit scWAT beiging (7, 27). Here, we found that IL-5 was also shown to be upregulated in 4MH- treated mice (Fig. 4D), indicating that the activation of HrH4 might promote scWAT browning through the mast cell-ILC2 axis.
		- This is less relevant for us.
	- 4MH increased VO2 consumption and heat generation during the dark cycle. Also rectal temperatures tended to be higher for mice treated with 4MH
	- The scWAT of mice treated with 4MH showed darker bands (Western blot) for PGC1A and UCP1.
	- This local injection did not affect BAT activity referring to unchanged UCP1 or PGC1‚ê£ levels be- tween PBS and 4MH groups
- Activation of HrH4 in C3H10T1/2 adipocytes induces browning phenotypes.
	- During the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells to adipocytes, they suffered an increase in the expression of Hrh4. 
	- The mature adipocytes were then treated with MH4. As the concentration of MH4 increases, the lipid-droplet size in the adipocytes decreases while the expression of UCP1, PGC1A and other thermogenic genes increases. 
	- There is also a decrease in the lipid content and higher increase in the release of glycerol (and hence use of triglycerides) for 4MH treated adipocytes.
	- The increase was not so significant in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes!
		- So careful with this section!!

- Activation of HrH4 triggers p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo.
	- We then sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which 4MH mediates the brown- ing effects.
	- They show increased expression of p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK in C3H10T1/2 adipocytes after 4MH treatment. The point of this experiment is that MAPK signaling increases after calcium increases inside the cell. Interestingly, HrH4 activation has been reported to increase the influx of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum to cytoplasm in mast cells. Therefore, the impact of HrH4 on browning could be mediated by MAPK signaling. They saw the same in adipocytes from scWAT of mice.
	- They also used SB203580 or U0126, which seem to be inhibitors of 4MH. The browning, in terms of lipid-droplet size and thermogenic-gene expression, associated with 4MH was blunted by the inhibitors.

## Summary

- Schematic model highlights the histamine H4 receptor (HrH4) function on adipocytes. HrH4 was highly expressed on the membrane of mature adipocytes isolated from the subcutaneous white adipose tissue, binding histamine released from mast cells, and eosinophils. When encountered with cold stimulation, HrH4 expression on adipocytes was increased, and mast cells and eosinophils would release more histamine, thus triggering the browning change of adipocytes. On top of that, the HrH4 agonist, 4-methylhistamine (4MH) bound HrH4 and induced the calcium flux from endoplasmic reticulum. Intracellular calcium mobilization caused the activation of p38/MAPK as well as ERK/MAPK pathways, which would upregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC1) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. In conclusion, HrH4 is a novel and vital regulator of adipocyte browning and energy homeostasis.
