# Gab2 deficiency suppresses high-fat diet-induced obesity by reducing adipose tissue inflammation and increasing brown adipose function in mice

## Introduction

- Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2) is a scaf- folding protein in the cytoplasm that participates in the amplification and integration of signal transduction when cells are stimulated by growth factors, cytokines, and antigens 20,21 . Gab2 recruits various intracellular down- stream effectors, including Ras, Src, p85, Shp2, Crk, PLC Î³, Shc, and SHIP
