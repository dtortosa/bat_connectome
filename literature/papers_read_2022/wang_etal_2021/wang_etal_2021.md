# Gab2 deficiency suppresses high-fat diet-induced obesity by reducing adipose tissue inflammation and increasing brown adipose function in mice

## Introduction

- Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2) is a scaf- folding protein in the cytoplasm that participates in the amplification and integration of signal transduction when cells are stimulated by growth factors, cytokines, and antigens 20,21 . Gab2 recruits various intracellular down- stream effectors, including Ras, Src, p85, Shp2, Crk, PLC γ, Shc, and SHIP


## Results

- WT mice fed under high-fat diet showed increased weight gain and Gab2 expression in BAT, iWAT and eWAT

- KO Gab2 mice gained less weight compared to WT under a high fat diet. Note that the KO did not have more food intake in grams. The difference is caused by fat mass, as lean mass is similar between WT and KO. Gab2 is influencing fat acumulation.
	- Thone in the standard diet ate more grams of food than those in the high-fat diet (independently of Gab2 deletion). I guess the HFD had more energy (mice under this diet became obese), so they had to eat less. The point is that intake is the same within Gab2 treatments, so the lower weight gain in Gab2 knockout under HFD suggest that it is caused by more energy production not lower intake.

- KO Gab2 under HFD showed lower increases in the mass of fat tissues and in some cases lower increases in adipocyte size. Interestingly, Gab2 deficiency increased the number of BAT adypocytes in both SD and HFD.

- Gab2 deficiency seems to decrease innflamation and improve glucose tolerance
	- BUT I HAVE NOT READ THESE SECTIONS. I have not read results nor methods.

- Higher UCP1 expression in Gab2 KO than in WT after 12 weeks of HFD (seen with a staining). No UCP1 changes in iWAT between WT and KO. Specific of BAT! It also increases mRNA expression of UCP1 and other thermogenic genes and genes implicated in mithocondrial function and fatty acid oxidation.

- They forced differentiation of brown pre-adipocytes in vitro showing higher UCP1 and lower Gab2 expression as the days passed. These pre-adipocytes were obtained from BAT of newborn Gab2 KO and WT mice.

- In addition, a UCP1-luciferasa reporter plasmid was co-transfected with EGFP-Gab2 plasmid or si-Gab2 into the brown preadipocytes. And then, cells were stimulated with β3-adrenergic agonist CL316, an activator of Ucp1 transcription. Overexpression of Gab2 supressed UCP1 activity, while knockdown of Gab2 increased the transcription of UCP1. UCP1 protein level was higher in Gab2 KO adipocytes than in WT adipocytes, having the former enhanced expression of several brown fat-selective genes.
	- Con are immortalized brown preadipocytes, while the rest should be differentiated adipocytes. This is the base line, before differentiation.
	- si-con, siRNA of control protei; si-Gab2 should be silence of Gab2, while EGFP-Gab2 should be overexpression of gab2.
	- the application of the upregulator of UCP1 (CL316,243), increases UCP1 lucifersase activity for all cases (respect to control without CL316,243) except for overexpressed gab2. In contrast, UCP1 content is much higher when Gab2 is silenced after the aplication (CL316,243).
	- The differentiated brown-adipocytes have more Ucp1 and less Gab2?
	- The final content of UCP1, Pgc1alpha and Cidea is higher in KO after the differentiation.

- They also show that the stimulation with CL316,243 in brown preadipocytes increased the phospholiration levels of Gab2, Akt and FoxO1, being the latter two implicated in the negative regulation of UCP1. This activation of Gab2, Akt and FoxO1 mediated by CL316,243 was suppressed by the deletion of Gab2. In contrast, overexpression of Gab2 enhanced the activation of Gab2, Akt, and FoxO1 induced by CL316,243. This suggests that Gab2 can negatively regulate the activation of the Ucp1 promoter in cells stimulated with CL316,243, and this regulation is possibly through Gab2 Akt-FoxO1 signaling pathways.
	- CL316,243 is an activator of Ucp1 transcription. I understand that overstimulation of UCP1 expression could stimulate the opposite, i.e., let's decrease UCP1 expression because this is too much. But the brown adipocytes need Gab2 to do that.
	- They also made analysis to check whether the influence of Gab2 in Akt is mediated by the sub-unit p85 of the enzyme PI3K, but I am not going to enter there.


## Methods

- The high fat diet is terrible, like always
