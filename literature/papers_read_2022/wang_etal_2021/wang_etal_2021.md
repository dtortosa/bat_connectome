# Gab2 deficiency suppresses high-fat diet-induced obesity by reducing adipose tissue inflammation and increasing brown adipose function in mice

## Introduction

- Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2) is a scaf- folding protein in the cytoplasm that participates in the amplification and integration of signal transduction when cells are stimulated by growth factors, cytokines, and antigens 20,21 . Gab2 recruits various intracellular down- stream effectors, including Ras, Src, p85, Shp2, Crk, PLC Î³, Shc, and SHIP

## Results

- WT mice fed under high-fat diet showed increased weight gain and Gab2 expression in BAT, iWAT and eWAT

- KO Gab2 mice gained less weight compared to WT under a high fat diet. Note that the KO did not have more food intake in grams. The difference is caused by fat mass, as lean mass is similar between WT and KO. Gab2 is influencing fat acumulation.

- KO Gab2 under HFD showed lower increases in the mass of fat tissues and in some cases lower increases in adipocyte size. Interestingly, Gab2 deficiency increased the number of BAT adypocytes in both SD and HFD.

- Gab2 deficiency seems to decrease innflamation and improve glucose tolerance, BUT I HAVE NOT READ THESE SECTIONS.

- Higher UCP1 expression in Gab2 KO than in WT after 12 weeks of HFD (seen with a staining). No UCP1 changes in iWAT between WT and KO. Specific of BAT! It also increases mRNA expression of UCP1 and other thermogenic genes and genes implicated in mithocondrial function and fatty acid oxidation.

- They forced differentiation of brown pre-adipocytes in vitro showing higher UCP1 and lower Gab2 expression as the days passed. These pre-adipocytes were obtained from BAT of newborn Gab2 KO and WT mice. 

- In addition, a UCP1-luciferasa reporter plasmid was co-transfected with EGFP-Gab2 plasmid or si-Gab2 into the brown preadipocytes. Overexpression of Gab2 supressed UCP1 activity, while knockdown of Gab2 increased the transcription of UCP1. UCP1 protein level was higher in Gab2 KO adipocytes than in WT adipocytes, having the former enhanced expression of several brown fat-selective genes.
