#Scripts for testing if number of the known BAT genes include in BAT connectome is higher than expected by chance. 


#HEMOS QUITADO EL TEST 4. 
	#esto sirve para testar que por azar no se explica haber conseguido justo esos 60 genes, que no es lo ideal, pero no tenemos una lista completa de bat genes a lo largo del genoma.
		#por eso hemos hecho el test 7, testando que los known BAT genes estan mas cerca entre respecto de random genes. Esto lo sugiri√≥ Yuval.
	#Sobre los problemas del Test 4: Si tener esos 60 known-BAT genes inside the BAT connectome is expected by chance.
		#We are checking in that way if we can get these 60 genes by chance just selecting a random set of 167 genes. This is not the best test. The best test would be check if random sets of genes have 60 or more known BAT genes (included or not in the connectome), but this would entail to curate all the human genes. We have the good and strong test comparing the distance between known-BAT and candidate genes with known-BAT and random genes. This is test 6 and compare the distance within the connectome but specifying between the two relevant groups, known and candidates. This is an upgrade of the initial test comparing distance inside and outside of the connectome.

###### CHANGES RESPECT TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS #######
###################################################

#Respect to version 1: In that version we calculate the proportion of random sets of 60 genes that have 60 known BAT genes. This is not correct. As Yuval pointed out, we need to select random sets of 167 genes (size of the BAT connectome) and check how many had our 60 known BAT genes inside. In that way we are checking if we can get these 60 genes by chance just selecting a random set of 167 genes. This is not the best test. The best test would be check if random sets of genes have 60 or more known BAT genes (included or not in the connectome), but this would entail to curate all the human genes. We have the good and strong test comparing the distance between known-BAT and candidate genes with known-BAT and random genes.
